# Wofair
Here are some works that i did between college time for a future company that will be named 'Wofair'

This is an introductory summary of what Wofair is about.
Wofair was ideallized by me and a very good friend of mine, it's a place where you can do whatever you want, it's a place where dreams come out to be true.
So, what's Wofair about?
It's about projects of things that doesn't exist, and it only does cause there's no real market for it, suppose u wanted a jetsuit that's capable of carrying a payload of 90 kg for 30 minutes, or you want a VANT for utilization on custom airsoft games, automated turrets with team recognition. Well, then u come to Wofair, since whatever isn't availlable out there, is just a challenge for us to outcome.

In this repository, you'll find some actual projects that we made, and the respective CAM/CAD models, feel free to e-mail us about any doubts or projects order u have on wofair.eng@gmail.com

We are engineers at the ready!
